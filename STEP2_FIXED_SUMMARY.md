# 🎉 Step 2 FIXED - Complete Working Scraper

## ✅ Issue Resolution

**Problem:** Step 2 was failing to find date and time fields
**Root Cause:** Website uses dropdown selectors instead of text inputs
**Solution:** Updated selectors to use correct dropdown elements found via diagnostic

## 🔧 Technical Fixes Applied

### 1. **Date Field Fix**
```python
# OLD (not working):
date_selectors = [
    "input[name='narozeni_datum']",
    "input[placeholder*='Date']", 
    "input[type='date']"
]

# NEW (working):
day_select = Select(driver.find_element(By.NAME, "narozeni_den"))
month_select = Select(driver.find_element(By.NAME, "narozeni_mesic"))  
year_select = Select(driver.find_element(By.NAME, "narozeni_rok"))
```

### 2. **Time Field Fix**
```python
# OLD (not working):
time_selectors = [
    "input[name='narozeni_cas']",
    "input[placeholder*='Time']"
]

# NEW (working):
hour_select = Select(driver.find_element(By.NAME, "narozeni_hodina"))
minute_select = Select(driver.find_element(By.NAME, "narozeni_minuta"))
```

### 3. **Alert Handling Added**
```python
# Handle clipboard copy alert popup
try:
    alert = driver.switch_to.alert
    alert.dismiss()  # Stay on page instead of redirecting
except:
    pass  # No alert present
```
