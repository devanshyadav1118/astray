**Example Output:**
> "Mars exalted in Capricorn in the 9th house indicates exceptional educational achievements and international opportunities, as stated in Brihat Parashara Hora Shastra."

#### **Temperature: 0.4-0.6 (Moderate)**
```python
# Balanced setting
temperature = 0.5
```
**Effects on Reports:**
- ✅ **Creative language** and engaging descriptions
- ✅ **Varied phrasing** across sections
- ⚠️ **Some inconsistency** between runs
- ⚠️ **Potential minor inaccuracies**

**Example Output:**
> "The magnificent exaltation of Mars in the steadfast sign of Capricorn, gracing the dharmic 9th house, weaves a tapestry of extraordinary educational destiny and far-reaching international influence."

#### **Temperature: 0.7+ (HIGH - NOT RECOMMENDED)**
```python
# Creative but risky
temperature = 0.8
```
**Effects on Reports:**

## **🎯 RECOMMENDED PARAMETER SETTINGS**

### **FOR YOUR ASTROLOGY PROJECT:**

```python
# Optimal configuration for classical accuracy + comprehensiveness
RECOMMENDED_CONFIG = {
    "model": "llama3.1:8b",
    "temperature": 0.2,           # Conservative for accuracy
    "max_rules": 60,             # Good coverage without overwhelming
    "min_confidence": 0.4,       # Balanced quality threshold
    "context_size": 8192,        # Standard context window
    "detail_level": "detailed",  # Professional depth
    "format": "markdown",        # Flexible output format
    "save_raw": True            # Keep raw AI response for debugging
}
```

### **PARAMETER TUNING PROCESS:**

1. **Start with recommended settings**
2. **Test with known chart** (like Devansh's)
3. **Adjust temperature** if too repetitive (+0.1) or inconsistent (-0.1)
4. **Adjust max_rules** based on desired report length
5. **Adjust min_confidence** based on accuracy vs completeness preference

---

## **🔍 DEBUGGING PARAMETER ISSUES**

### **Common Problems & Solutions:**

#### **"AI responses too repetitive"**
```python
# Increase creativity
temperature = 0.3 → 0.4
```

#### **"AI making things up"**
```python
# Decrease creativity, increase accuracy
temperature = 0.5 → 0.2
min_confidence = 0.3 → 0.5
```

#### **"Reports too short"**
```python
# Include more rules
max_rules = 30 → 60
min_confidence = 0.6 → 0.4
```

#### **"Processing too slow"**
```python
# Reduce computational load
max_rules = 100 → 50
context_size = 16384 → 8192
```

#### **"Low quality rules included"**
```python
# Increase quality threshold
min_confidence = 0.3 → 0.5
```

**The parameters are crucial!** They determine whether you get a quick 600-word summary or a comprehensive 15,000-word analysis, whether the AI stays faithful to classical sources or gets creative, and whether processing takes 15 seconds or 2 minutes.

For your 1,287 rules database, I recommend starting with the balanced professional setup and adjusting based on your specific needs and hardware capabilities.
